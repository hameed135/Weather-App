# Weather-App
Thrilled to showcase my latest project: a Weather App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the AccuWeather API! üå§Ô∏è Users can search any city to get real-time weather data, including temperature, conditions, and day/night visuals. Through this project, I deepened my skills in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), DOM manipulation, and responsive design with Bootstrap. A great learning experience! Check it out and let me know your thoughts! #WebDevelopment #JavaScript #API #WeatherApp #CodingProjects"
