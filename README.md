# Weather-App
Thrilled to showcase my latest project: a Weather App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the AccuWeather API! üå§Ô∏è Users can search any city to get real-time weather data, including temperature, conditions, and day/night visuals. Through this project,

I deepened my skills in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), DOM manipulation, and responsive design with Bootstrap. 

A great learning experience! Check it out and let me know your thoughts! #WebDevelopment #JavaScript #API #WeatherApp #CodingProjects"


Purpose: Created a web-based Weather App that provides real-time weather information for any city entered by the user.

Technologies Used: Built using HTML for structure, CSS (with Bootstrap) for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, integrated with the AccuWeather API.

User Input: Features a form where users can type a city name to fetch weather data.

API Integration: Utilizes two AccuWeather API endpoints‚ÄîgetCity to retrieve city details (e.g., city key) and getWeather to fetch current weather conditions using the city key.

Dynamic UI Updates: Updates the interface with: City name.

Current weather description (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy").

Temperature in Celsius.

A weather icon matching the condition (e.g., sun, clouds).

A day or night image based on local time (IsDayTime property).

Asynchronous JavaScript: Employs async/await for handling API requests and promises to ensure smooth data retrieval and error handling.

Responsive Design: Styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly layout, including a card-based display and centered weather icon.

Event Handling: Listens for form submission, prevents default behavior, processes the input, and updates the UI dynamically.
