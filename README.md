# Weather-App
a Weather App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the AccuWeather API! üå§Ô∏è Users can search any city for real-time weather updates, including temperature, conditions, and day/night visuals. This project helped me master API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), DOM manipulation, and responsive design with Bootstrap.
